When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    A remote repository would be of greater importance when working on a collaborative
    project with other people, this would keep the workflow very neat and easy to manage.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Your remote repository most at times would likely be your production version, while
    the local repository would be the development version, so automatically pull from your
    production version(remote) into your local version while probably experimenting a new
    future or working on a bug fix could break your code base for a while giving you some
    easily avoidable headache.
